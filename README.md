# smashing-magazine-design
This project was built from The Odin Project HTML/CSS curriculum.

In this simple project, ive broken apart the website for a popular design magazine Smashing Magazine. https://www.smashingmagazine.com/
The goal for this exercise is to start training to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.
Ive created a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy.
